This is a little experiment my dad and I did at home, trying to recycle paper at home, achieving a handmade paper texture to it.  
Thought the paper didn't turn out perfect, I really enjoyed this mini-project of ours!  
Try out the steps in the captions of the images and let me know how your results were!
